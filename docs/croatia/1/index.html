Our first impression was one of peace. Dubai airport at 5.30am on a Sunday morning was horrendous chaos and a sensory overload. Zagreb airport, by contrast, small(er), new, spacious, well laid out and almost devoid of other people. It is also interesting architecturally: <a href=https://www.archdaily.com/870849/zagreb-airport-kincl-plus-neidhardt-plus-institut-igh> Archdaily. </a> The expert says it looks like a giant slug. </p> <p> We caught an Uber to our accommodation in town, and had an enthusiastic conversation about Croatia’s recent Fifa World Cup success with our driver (who also happens to be a fan of Mamelodi Sundowns, and has some strong opinions about Benni McCarthy). </p> <p> Zagreb was peaceful. It may have had something to do with the fact that it was a Sunday afternoon, and many of the shops were closed, but it was a pleasure exploring the streets and feeling like we almost had the place to ourselves. We took a walk through town to the Cathedral, and explored some of the pedestrianised streets of the city which are lined with restaurants and bars. </p> <div class="svelte-18ue57n gallery"> <div class="svelte-18ue57n modal-hide"> <div> <img alt="" class="svelte-18ue57n modal-image" src=""> <span class=svelte-18ue57n></span> </div> </div> <img alt="" class=svelte-18ue57n src="img/croatia/croatia (3).jpg"><img alt="" class=svelte-18ue57n src="img/croatia/croatia (9).jpg"> </div> <p> We also stumbled upon St Mark’s church, with striking roof tiles, before visiting the Museum of Broken Relationships. It houses objects from various relationships that have ended, and each object has a short story or description accompanying it. The stories range from absurd to sad to funny - my favourite being the description of an antique pocket-watch: “She said she loved all things old and broken. Turns out she didn’t. That’s probably why we’re no longer together.” There was also an axe displayed, which a jilted lover used to chop their ex-partners furniture into tiny pieces. </p> <div class="svelte-18ue57n gallery"> <div class="svelte-18ue57n modal-hide"> <div> <img alt="" class="svelte-18ue57n modal-image" src=""> <span class=svelte-18ue57n></span> </div> </div> <img alt="" class=svelte-18ue57n src="img/croatia/croatia (4).jpg"><img alt="" class=svelte-18ue57n src="img/croatia/croatia (1).jpg"> </div> <p> The next day we explored the picturesque Botanical Gardens, and the Croatian History Museum. We also found Gric Tunnel, which was built during WWII as a bomb shelter and promenade, which provided some relief from the heat of the city above. </p> <div class="svelte-18ue57n gallery"> <div class="svelte-18ue57n modal-hide"> <div> <img alt="" class="svelte-18ue57n modal-image" src=""> <span class=svelte-18ue57n></span> </div> </div> <img alt="" class=svelte-18ue57n src="img/croatia/croatia (7).jpg"> </div> <nav class=svelte-1ol01ne> <a href=croatia>Previous</a> <a href=croatia/2>Next</a> </nav> </main> </div></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,{}]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');(function(){try{eval("async function x(){}");var main="/client/client.f02d1dc2.js"}catch(e){main="/client/legacy/client.b6d7b80c.js"};var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src=main;s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main",main);}document.head.appendChild(s);}());</script>
