    Our journey out of Ninh Binh was not as smooth as the one into it had been.
    A taxi driver picked us up from our accommodation, and drove us to a street
    just adjacent to the train station in town, where we were unceremoniously
    dropped on the pavement of a friend or relative’s coffee shop, with
    assurances that our bus would be coming “soon”, and multiple envelopes
    changing hands.

  <p>
    After a dutiful cup of coffee, we piled into the Sprinter that picked us up,
    and started on the long, jerky, swervy, stop-start journey, as more people
    climbed in along the way, always space for one more. After a longer ride
    than expected, we arrived at the Ha Long Bay bus station, where we found a
    taxi to take us back a few km’s to where the ferry terminal was to go to Cat
    Ba. I was feeling rather green from the bus trip, and the thought of the
    ferry was not improving my mood, however, we pulled up just in time to see
    the last ferry for the day sailing away into the bay.

    Duncan quickly found a local man with a speed boat, so we piled in and set
    off across Ha Long Bay to Cat Ba, where we disembarked to find ourselves
    stranded on the northern side of the island, 14km from where we would be
    staying. An industrious taxi driver (the only one around) offered to take us
    there for the equivalent of a night’s accommodation for 4 people. We
    eventually gave in, and he took us on the winding road down the spine of the
    island, undulating green jungle-covered hills on either side.

    Our accommodation for the night was a traditional Vietnamese house, 165
    years old, tucked down a panhandle off the main road. It was long and dark,
    with shuttered doors on the front, and divided into 7 sections inside by
    large columns. Inside was sparsely decorated with a few beds and some
    traditional antique furniture. We came to appreciate this house more and
    more as we explored Cat Ba, which has rows and rows of ugly, concrete neon
    lit hotels and hostels along the harbour front.

    We spent our first day exploring the island on scooters, and visited the
    Hospital cave, where the residents of the island established a field
    hospital to treat the sick and wounded during the American War, in which Cat
    Ba was heavily bombed. The hospital consisted of a concrete bunker with
    wards and various other rooms, and an upper level with the natural cave roof
    which was used for meetings and socialising of the hospital staff. There was
    a third level, above part of the concrete, which had a large sign reading
    FORBIDDEN GROUND.
