    We arrived in the capital of the South and settled into a routine of trying
    to cross the road without being killed. Step number one involves trying to
    find an intersection with a robot, or at least a zebra crossing. While cars
    and busses generally eventually stop at red lights, for the thousands of
    scooters they are merely a suggestion. The next step is to wait for a gap in
    the traffic, and then step confidently into the road, and walk calmly and
    consistently until reaching the other side. Meanwhile, by some miracle the
    scooter traffic adjusts its speed and direction to avoid hitting you and
    each other in a something of a dance. We assume this system works on account
    of the maneuverability of two-wheeled vehicles, the sheer volume of traffic,
    and the fact that as a result nobody is really able to drive very fast.

    We made our way to the War Remnants Museum, formerly known as the Museum of
    Chinese and American War Crimes. After a very brief overview of some
    political aspects of the war, the museum goes into great visual detail, with
    exhibition halls showcasing war photography and journalism from both sides.
    There is a lot of detail and many displays about war crimes committed by the
    US military, often with the use of photos taken by US journalists. Agent
    Orange and it’s immediate and long-term effects are also gruesomely
    displayed. The final exhibit details the global anti-war movement at the
    time. We found the museum biased in that it was rather American-centric, but
    not unjustly so. For a differently-biased view, we recommend watching The
    Vietnam War, a Ken Burns documentary which we have reflected on many times
    so far this trip.

    In the evening we wandered around the vibrant city, that never seems to slow
    down or sleep. There are still many buildings that serve as a reminder of
    the country’s colonial past under the French, including Vietnamese Notre
    Dame and the Post Office. We had an iced coffee and delicious street food
    dinner at Turtle Lake, a public space in the middle of a busy traffic
    circle, with elevated paths and water fountains.
