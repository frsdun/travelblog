    We left Hue and flew north to the capital city of Hanoi, at first glance a
    grungier version of Ho Chi Minh City. We spent the evening walking around
    the nearby Hoam Kiem lake, full of locals enjoying the street magic,
    musicians and entertainers that were out in full force on Friday evening.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next morning Chris and Ana joined us, and we visited the Vietnamese
    Women’s museum, which was an interesting look at Vietnamese life in general,
    detailing customs in various tribes relating to marriage, childbirth and
    family life, as well as recognising prominent Vietnamese women through the
    ages.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also spent some time in the Hoa Lo Prison, where Vietnamese
    revolutionaries were held by the French, and later where captured Americans
    were imprisoned and reportedly referred to the prison as the “Hanoi Hilton”.
    The now museum spends large sections of it’s display referencing how well
    the American prisoners were treated there, showing pictures of them playing
    volleyball, smoking, celebrating Christmas, and meeting international media
    where they (voluntarily or under duress) praised the Vietnamese for their
    wonderful treatment and condemned the ongoing war efforts by the US.
  </p>
  <p>
    After our history lesson sprinkled with some “light” propaganda, we made our
    way across town to the Temple of Literature, also known as the Temple of
    Confucius. Built in 1070, it hosts the Imperial Academy, Vietnam’s first
    university and has 5 pavilions and 5 courtyards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thereafter, we made our way to “Train Street”. A residential “street” in
    Hanoi, where there are only train tracks in place of a road. Twice a day, a
    train thunders through the narrow alleyway between houses. We arrived at
    3pm, shortly before the train was due to come through at 3:30pm, and
    witnessed locals packing up their tables and chairs, moving their belongings
    out of danger, and warning unsuspecting tourists to get out the way. A few
    also burnt (fake) wads of money on the tracks for good luck. And then
    suddenly, whistle screeching, it came around the corner, seemingly inches
    from the buildings lining the tracks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within a minute, the train had passed, and people were back setting up their
    tables and chairs, wheeling theirs scooters across the train tracks, and
    life went on…
  </p>
  <p>
    We moved on to the Vietnamese Museum of Ethnology, where a variety of
    traditional Vietnamese houses have been built to full scale on the property.
    Many of them were donated by families, and so were disassembled and
    relocated to be rebuilt at the museum. We spent a fascinating few hours
    exploring these many dwellings, particularly interesting were the two below:
    the tall house was a communal dwelling, and built to show the skill and
    strength of the men who constructed it. The long house has a communal area
    inside, and then multiple rooms separated by bamboo screens where couples in
    the family would sleep. In large families, the house could reach 250m long –
    as the younger generation got married, more rooms would be built onto the
    end.

  <p>
    We spent the evening eating street food, and once again walking around the
    very festive lake area, where children and students were out in full force
    asking if they could chat to us in order to practice their English,
    sometimes with a nudge from their nearby parents.
