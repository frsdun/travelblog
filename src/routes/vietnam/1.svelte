    After a whirlwind wedding weekend and a crazy week of work back in Cape
    Town, we set off to Vietnam on our rather unconventional honeymoon. A brief
    layover in Singapore airport was a welcome relief after a long 10 hour
    flight â€“ we were grateful for the chance to stretch our legs, and the
    beautiful gardens scattered around the airport in stark contrast to the neon
    lights of Duty Free.

    Another short flight later, we landed in hot and humid Ho Chi Ming City, and
    caught an Uber to our accommodation with Chris and Ana in the nearby
    province of Binh Duong. Chris and Ana live in a fancy apartment building
    filled with expats and all amenities, but there are no tourists in the area.

    While we waited for our hosts, who were on a later flight, we set off on
    foot in search of some dinner. A short walk up the road revealed a
    restaurant in among some trees, and the young boy who greeted us burst into
    laughter and handed us menus in Vietnamese. After a quick session on Google
    translate, we managed to ask for chicken. He explained (again via Google
    translate) that we would have to order a whole chicken. We asked him to
    recommend something else. He recommended the dove. After a long back and
    forth, we realised that this was basically the only dish available on the
    menu. More laughter at our expense, and he disappeared to prepare our food.

    Duncan, as a rule, likes his meat to be free of bones and faces, and
    anything resembling the original animal. We had an ironic discussion about
    the cognitive biases around our meat-eating habits in general, before
    tentatively tucking into our small but tasty meal. We paid and thanked our
    host, who was still laughing at us, before heading back to our
    accommodation. Chris and Ana have subsequently pointed out a variety of
    other restaurants all within about 100m, that serve beef and pork and
    chicken.
