    We left Hanoi for Ninh Binh in a smooth travel sequence, starting with an
    Uber driver that took us directly to the correct bus, already on route;
    ending with a friendly and conveniently (perhaps strategically) placed
    taxi-driver that was waiting when the bus dropped us off on the side of the
    road in the middle of nowhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ninh Binh itself is an ugly, industrial looking town with no attraction, but
    the surrounding countryside is spectacular, with dramatic limestone karsts,
    a huge network of caves, and a maze of valleys and rivers in between the
    tall peaks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our accommodation was out in a beautiful valley, and we immediately set
    about hiring scooters. Duncan found a motorbike and became quite attached to
    the Honda Win100; fortunately for me riding pillion it was less powerful
    than the scooters but with slightly better suspension.
  </p>
  <p>
    We made our way through small villages until we came to the end of a road,
    where there was a bird park. We ventured off the main path of tourists up a
    mountain with 500 odd stairs, to a cave. Inside the cave, another steep
    flight down took you to “hell”, a cavern full of stalactites; while
    ascending from the entrance took you to “heaven”, a beautiful viewpoint over
    the surrounding landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    We took a short boat ride through a flooded cave system under a limestone
    pinnacle, before joining the main walkways of the bird park – safe to say,
    in typical Vietnamese style, the birds were not the main attraction.
    Manicured shrubs, and carefully curated selfie-spots were the main interest
    for majority of the tourists, who even kept changing outfits for their
    pictures in among the fake flowers next to the Vespa surrounded by coloured
    lights.
  </p>
  <p>
    We took another boat ride to the end of the park where the birds live in
    trees in the middle of the lake. We saw mostly storks and herons, coming
    home to feed their chicks and roost just before sunset, and it was amazing
    to be peacefully rowed around the lake with hundreds of squawking birds, and
    finally, almost devoid of other tourists.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was getting close to sunset, and the day-trippers from Hanoi were leaving
    in their droves by bus. We decide to head home via a small temple that we
    had seen earlier. The Bich Dong Pagoda was built in the 15th century, and is
    built into the side of steep limestone cliffs, some levels set into caves.
  </p>
  <p>
    We made our way to the top level, and admired the already spectacular view,
    before deciding to ignore the sign that said “Do Not Climb”, and scrambled
    up the sleep, sharp rocks to the peak of the mountain in time for a
    spectacular sunset. Chris hurt his foot a few weeks ago in a scooter
    accident which has resulted in some swelling and bruising that has made
    wearing closed shoes painful. Needless to say, he did the whole climb and
    descent (once again) in plakkies, cursing Duncan the whole way for
    jeopardising our lives – a bit dramatic perhaps, but the ascent was steep
    and exposed, and we were climbing over razor-sharp rocks most of the way.

  <p>The view from the top – worth it!</p>
