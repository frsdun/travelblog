    We booked a day trip to the Mekong Delta through a tour company, and boarded
    our bus and commenced our journey, before making an unexpected stop that
    wasn’t on our itinerary. Our bus came to a halt outside a factory, and we
    were given lanyards with a number on them and ushered into a stark room lit
    by fluorescent lights. A lady dressed in bright pink then came and
    demonstrated some products to us, all allegedly made with bamboo and coconut
    husks. These included plastic toothbrushes, blankets, scarves, charcoal
    toothpaste and my favourite – a hair towel that dries 80-90% of your hair
    while you wear it, “so that you can do other tasks while your hair dries,
    like cook, clean and look after your family“. Needless to say, we were not
    their preferred target market.

    We eventually arrived at the Mekong delta and boarded a boat that took us to
    a series of islands, all rather saturated with tourists, and each with an
    “activity”, following which we were shown related products that we could
    buy. We tasted local fruit, listened to some traditional music, tasted some
    honey, took a trip in a small Vietnamese canoe, watched sweets being made
    from coconut and had a group lunch. The islands themselves are beautiful,
    fertile and full of life, forming a patchwork on the brown waters together
    with floating markets and communities.

    We were happy to be back in HCMC, and set off to treat ourselves to a fancy
    dinner in a rooftop garden in the city, before taking a walk through town
    via an ice cream store.

    The next morning we found the Bird Cafe; a coffee shop in a big park in the
    middle of town. Every morning Vietnamese men gather together with their
    caged songbirds, and hang the cages together so that the birds can socialise
    with each other.

    We had a quick iced coffee amidst the beautiful chirping, and then made our
    way to the Reunification Palace, which was the home and workplace of the
    South Vietnamese president during the war.

    Architecturally an interesting modernist building and with a tumultuous
    history, it was a fascinating building to explore, complete with all the
    opulent furnishings and some 60’s kitsch
