    The next day, another national park; this time on our doorstep, and the
    initial reason for staying in this particular Starigrad. A short drive
    brought us to a spectacular gorge, with limestone cliffs towering above us
    on both sides. Paklenica is Croatia’s most popular climbing destination, and
    one day hardly did it justice. We hired a rope and some gear, and warmed up
    on some rather polished, well climbed easy routes, before crossing the
    narrow valley to do a 3 pitch multipitch climb, of just over 100m. Duncan
    climbed to the first set of anchors, while I belayed him from the ground. He
    then tied into the anchors and belayed me up. Then I tied in and belayed him
    up the second pitch, and we repeated this until we were both at the top of
    the climb.

    Unfortunately we don’t have many photos, as two hands are required for both
    climbing and belaying!
