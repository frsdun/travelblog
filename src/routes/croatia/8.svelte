    We made our way to Split by bus and checked into our accommodation, an
    apartment owned by an elderly couple who lived in the flat below. They spoke
    little English but immediately started feeding us, and we had a steady
    supply of sandwiches, pastries, juice and sweet treats delivered to our door
    and in the corridor every time we came and went.

    The old town of Split centres around the Diocletian Palace, built by the
    Roman Emperor in 295 AD, and transformed by subsequent generations ever
    since. Surrounded by high walls it is now a warren of apartments, shops,
    restaurants, museums, churches and squares; with a tangled maze of narrow
    alleyways. Under the palace, the basement was constructed to elevate the
    Emperor's apartments in order for him too have a better view and sea breeze.
    It perfectly mirrors the original floor plan of the palace above, and we
    explored the vast halls one evening after dinner.

    We also took a bus to Klis fortress, built on a steep rock pinnacle next to
    a strategic mountain pass, originally fortified by the Romans. There is an
    impressive view across the valley towards Split and the Adriatic islands
    beyond. The fortress is remarkably intact, and makes for great exploring of
    cobblestone walkways, storehouse, barracks, lookout towers and a small
    chapel. A small museum explains how the Uskoks were fierce,undefeated
    warriors for more than 25 years before finally losing the fortress to the
    Ottomans.

    Back in Split, we wandered across town to the Maritime museum, also housed
    in an old fortress. It housed an impressive collection of model ships
    throughout the ages, including the Yugoslav navy destroyer Split, which
    ironically attacked its namesake city in 1991. There was also an impressive
    display on the invention and subsequent use of torpedos.

    We then managed to find Bacvice beach, Split’s “best” “sandy” beach. Beaches
    in Croatia are described as rocky, pebble, shingle or sandy, the latter
    being the most desirable. The water is warm and shallow and clear but the
    beaches themselves are average at best, with a small patch of dirty sand
    crowded with people roasting themselves in the sun. There are no waves and
    seemingly no tides, so they are a bit boring, and we are rather spoilt.

    We spent the evening climbing a small hill next to the city for beautiful
    sunset views, before descending for dinner in the city.
