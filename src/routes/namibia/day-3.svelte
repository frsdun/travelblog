    After a quick breakfast we packed up camp - luckily this just basically
    involves closing the roof top tent. We spent the most part of the morning
    driving the most spectacular road along the banks of the Orange River, with
    lush greenery close to it’s banks, and desolate desert just a few metres
    away. The undulating road hugs the river bank and made for exciting driving,
    before joining a tar road north through Rosh Pinah.

    We then continued onto Aus, and then to Luderitz, spotting some wild horses
    and the occasional abandoned railway house along the way. Our conclusion
    thus far is that Namibia only considers tarring their roads if there is
    proximity to grapes or diamonds.

    We arrived in Luderitz and followed signs to Agate Beach, which is a long
    and barren beach just north of town. The blustery weather made for an
    uninspiring trip, although it looks like it may be a popular picnic and
    braai spot over weekends in good weather.

    We spent the afternoon doing some admin and shopping, and running
    inexplicably late for everything we tried to do. It would take us another
    day to realise that we had erroneously turned our clocks back an hour when
    we crossed the border; not realising that Namibia had abolished switching to
    GMT +1 for “winter time” in 2017, and now uses the same time as SA all year
    round. Nevertheless, we had what we thought was an early supper of Luderitz
    oysters and fresh seafood after exploring the town.
