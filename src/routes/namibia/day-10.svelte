    We were unprepared for how stiff and sore we were when we woke up. The palms
    of our hands were bruised from pressing on sharp granite, and I manoeuvred
    myself out of bed using mostly my elbows, every muscle aching. Duncan set up
    a birthday treasure hunt around camp, made me some more tea and then went
    back to bed. I was too stiff to climb back up the ladder, so I sank into the
    camping chair and enjoyed the morning sun.

    After a slow start, we drove into the park and did some exploring. We found
    a small rock pool, and the striking rock arch that bus loads of tourists
    come to see every day. We marvelled at Spitzkoppe and the Pontoks from every
    angle.

    In the afternoon, we had a swim and the celebratory beer we had been
    dreaming of after the descent of the previous day. It was worth the wait!
