    Another early start. We joined a long queue of vehicles at 6:15, waiting to
    enter the national park gates when they open an hour before sunrise. As the
    gates open, hoards of tourists in their rental 4x4’s race down 60km of tar
    road in an attempt to get to the end first, and we assume, get the best
    sunrise photos. We took a more leisurely pre-dawn drive, and parked at the
    end of the tar road, from which you can only proceed with a 4x4 through the
    last 6km of very thick sand. Reluctant to get the car stuck, we set off on
    foot into the desert, vaguely following a hand painted sign to Hiddenvlei.
    We watched a beautiful sunrise from amongst the dunes, devoid of any other
    people, and eventually stumbled on the amazing vlei after about 2km of
    walking.

    We arrived back at the parking lot to find it had filled up considerably,
    and a shuttle service was now offering lifts through the sand to Sossusvlei.
    We hopped on, and after a short drive and a hot walk, we laid eyes on the
    spectacular Deadvlei. The white clay pan is starkly contrasted by dark dead
    trees, and the surrounding orange dunes. And people everywhere, all trying
    to get a photo without any other people in it.

    Always up for a summit, we decided to climb the adjacent dune “Big Daddy”.
    It was only about 9:30am but the sun was already baking and the sand was
    soft. Like the proverbial frog in the well, we slid back down again with
    every step up, making hot and tiring work. We finally got to the peak and
    enjoyed spectacular 360 degree views over the surrounding desert dunes. We
    then ran back down the dune, which was considerably quicker and more fun
    than the hike up!

    We drove back to camp for a swim and waited out the heat of the day in the
    shade, and then spent the rest of the afternoon exploring Sesriem canyon.
    Almost invisible from ground level, the canyon has been carved into the
    ground by water flowing through sedimentary rock over millions of years, and
    has a small permanent rock pool at one end which offers respite to many of
    the animals in the area.
