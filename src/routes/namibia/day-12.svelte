    Once again a quick pack-up of camp after breakfast, and we were on the road
    again to another striking granite mountain range, this time the Erongo
    mountains. The scenery gradually became greener as we drove, and we saw
    fewer tourists on the way.

    Our campsite was situated on a farm, and we had the whole place to
    ourselves. We did some very hot midday exploring, before retreating into the
    shade for lunch and a relaxed afternoon. Once it started to get cooler, we
    set off on a walk to the top of the ridge behind our camp. We were
    accompanied by zebra and baboons as we zigzagged our way up the path, and we
    were treated to an amazing view as the sun was setting from the top.
