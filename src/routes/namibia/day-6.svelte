    Once again we packed up camp in the dark, and joined the 4x4 queue to get
    into the park. Our destination was a large sand dune about 40km down the
    road, which we dubbed Dune 40. Dune 45 lies at the 45km mark and is the most
    photographed sand dune in the desert. We chose the quieter, equally
    impressive earlier dune to climb, and began our ascent in the faint pre-dawn
    light. We thought we were making good progress and just before sunrise
    thought we were almost at the top, but the dune had a vanishing summit that
    seemed ever out of reach.

    The sun rose and turned the dunes bright orange, and we eventually made it
    to the peak for a quick drink of water and a marvel at the view, before
    another exhilarating running descent.

    We left Sesriem mid morning, and stopped briefly in Solitaire for schnitzels
    and legendary apple pie for lunch. We arrived in Walvis Bay and got our
    first puncture driving along the beachfront. We changed it quickly and
    continued up the coast to Swakopmund, and into the fog.
