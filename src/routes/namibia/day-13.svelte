    We packed up camp after a quick breakfast, and began our drive to Windhoek.
    We were happy to encounter gradually better and better roads, until finally
    we were on tar again, just in time for Friday afternoon peak hour traffic.
    We spent some of the afternoon in search of a new tyre, together with what
    seemed like the entire population of Windhoek. We then set about exploring
    town, and visited the Independence Memorial Museum, which would look at home
    in Pyongyang. It was a fascinating museum however, and showed a different
    history of Namibia to the colonial German history presented by the museum in
    Swakopmund. We popped in at the beautiful “gingerbread church”
    Christuskirche, and the very tired Owela museum, before winding down for the
    day with a walk through the botanical gardens and dinner at the famous Joe’s
    Beerhouse.

    The next morning we set off in the dark on our long drive home. Just outside
    Windhoek, Duncan had to contend with some hairy driving in the dark, as the
    side of the road was inhabited by all manner of wild animals. We saw kudu,
    oryx, springbok, eland, zebra, hares; and a variety of animals
    indistinguishable except for their glowing eyes. Sunrise was a welcome
    relief, and we crossed the border into Botswana uneventfully. Thereafter the
    road was lined with more domestic animals - donkeys, cattle, sheep and dogs
    - but the roads were quiet and we had a smooth journey back to SA, home in
    time for a supper of steak and chips.
