    We set off early from Augrabies and made our way through some small Northern
    Cape towns to the border at Vioolsdrift, where we had an uneventful
    crossing. We then turned sharp West, and made our way along the Orange River
    to Norotshama River Resort, situated on the banks of the river on the farm
    of Aussenkehr, the largest table grape farm in the Southern Hemisphere.

    Our objective here was to find the climbing on the farm, and after picking
    up keys and permits from the local Spar, we drove to King’s Kloof Canyon,
    where we were greeted by a large male kudu. The dolomite cliffs rise from
    right next to the road, and after a quick lunch we spent the afternoon
    harnessed up, climbing and enjoying the beautiful landscape.

    We climbed until sunset, and then headed back to camp, only to find that in
    all our shopping we had forgotten to buy fuel for our stove. We had
    sandwiches for supper and an early bed.
