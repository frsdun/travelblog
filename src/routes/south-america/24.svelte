    Bolivia is a country of extremes; in places the poorest, highest, wettest,
    driest, saltiest, coldest and warmest on the continent; and in the case of
    La Paz, the craziest. The dense, red-brick city sits in a bowl, surrounded
    by altiplanic peaks of up to 6000m, a maze of steep, narrow roads winding up
    the hillsides from the CBD in the centre.

    We arrived 2 hours earlier than expected, at 6:30am on a Sunday morning
    after an overnight bus ride. La Paz was like a ghost city, and we wandered
    around trying to kill time, as our check-in was only at 3pm. We found some
    street markets being set up by Cholitas (the local women) dressed in puffy,
    multi-layered pleated skirts, a thick shawl over a simple blouse, with a
    bowler hat atop long plaited pigtails. Ironically, this section of the
    market was selling fake North Face and Colombia outdoor wear. We spent the
    day in various museums and the central park (mostly concrete), before making
    our way to our accommodation, a fantastic apartment which we shared with
    Alice and David.

    The next day, we set out again to explore the city, which was now bustling
    in comparison to when we arrived. We explored fascinating markets, including
    the Witches Market, where you can buy, among other things, llama fetuses to
    bury under your house as an offering to Pachamama (mother earth).

    La Paz has a huge problem with traffic, given the geography and density of
    the city, and we soon realised after a short taxi ride that there are no
    rules. In an attempt to curb this problem, the city has erected cable cars
    as a form of public transport, which tower above the traffic and offer
    spectacular views of the city. Three lines of the proposed seven have been
    built, and seem to be well used by locals and tourists alike. For the
    equivalent of R6 we could ride the length of a line, and we spent the
    afternoon taking in the madness from above.
