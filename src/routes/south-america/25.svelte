    The Yungas Road, also known as the Death Road, is a road leading from La Paz
    to the small town of Coroico. From La Paz, the road ascends to an altitude
    of 4650m at the La Cumbre pass, before descending over 3500m in 64km into
    the Amazonian rain forest. Largely single lane, with no barriers, cut into
    the side of steep mountain slopes, eroded in places and covered by
    landslides elsewhere, and littered with crosses where vehicles and people
    have gone over the edge, it was named “The Worlds Most Dangerous Road” by
    the Inter-American Bank in the 1990’s.

  <p>Perfect for downhill mountain biking…</p>

    We met our tour guide and travelled to the top of La Cumbre pass by minibus,
    where we were given proper downhill mountain bikes and fitted with helmets,
    jackets and knee pads. We rode the first couple of kilometres on a tarred
    road to familiarise ourselves with the bikes, before turning off at the
    start of the Death Road.

    Although a double lane tar road has been built as an alternative, the Death
    Road is still a public road, and sometimes preferably used as it is more
    direct. However, being the rainy season, a huge landslide near the bottom
    had made the road impassable to motor vehicles a few weeks prior to our
    ride, so apart from other cyclists and support vehicles, we had it to
    ourselves.

    We set off downhill, with sheer vertical drops to our left into the valley
    below. Although not particularly technical, the ride required a bit of
    confidence and a lot of concentration (also, as I was to discover, forearms
    and buttocks of steel). The narrowest bits where the edge had eroded were
    about 3.5m wide, and there were wet sections where waterfalls fell onto our
    heads as we cycled past, as well as two river crossings. We were a small
    group of 7 for most of the way, and our guide was a former national champion
    mountain biker, who had been riding this route for more than 10 years. We
    had frequent stops for water, snacks, and information about what was to come
    on the next section, as well as an opportunity to admire the spectacular
    views.

    Mid-afternoon, we descended into the jungle next to a river, where food,
    showers and a swimming pool were awaiting us, before loading up the minivan
    and heading back to town via the new road. Tired, stiff and dirty, this was
    without a doubt one of the highlights of our trip!
