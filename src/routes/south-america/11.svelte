  <h2>Day 5: Camp Dickson to Los Perros</h2>
  <p>
    It rained consistently throughout the night, and we slept in, safe in the
    knowledge that we only had about a 4 hour walk to accomplish for the day. A
    brief break in the rain at about 9am signaled our chance, and we quickly ate
    breakfast and set off. The weather worsened as we walked through beautiful
    forests, and we spent a large portion of the day debating if it was actually
    snowing or not… Nevertheless, icy stuff was falling from the sky!
  </p>
  <p>
    We arrived at camp by about 2pm and set up our still dripping tent from the
    previous night. We allowed it to air a bit before it started snowing
    properly and we had to retreat back into its’ shelter. It snowed for the
    rest of the afternoon, and by the time we emerged to make supper, the area
    surrounding camp was covered in a beautiful layer of white powder.
  </p>
  <p>
    We had a hearty supper planned, consisting of chorizo sausages, smash, onion
    and dehydrated vegetables – also with the intent of eating all our remaining
    heavy food before the steep pass we had to hike the next day. We were smugly
    setting up for our feast in the common cooking area, pitying those around us
    who were drinking Cup-O-Soup and eating 2-minute noodles. We had failed to
    realise that our packet of dehydrated vegetables (and the other packet we
    were saving), were in fact dehydrated seaweed. As we tipped the packet into
    the pot of boiling water, we noticed the “fishy” smell, which worsened with
    cooking. The Chileans sitting next to us had a good laugh when they
    translated the label for us; and warned us not to mix it with our other
    food!
  </p>
  <h2>Day 6: Los Perros to Camp Paso</h2>
  <p>
    I had nightmares the whole night about getting lost in the snow, freezing
    feet, and slipping down icy embankments. We had one of the biggest days
    ahead, climbing up and over the John Garner pass, and the snow had fallen
    all night. We dressed warmly and set off in the fresh snow (fortunately one
    of the park guides helped break the trail with the first walkers). It was
    slow going, with many small streams and rivers to cross in slippery
    conditions – mud and ice. After about 15 minutes we both had shoes that were
    completely soaked through, and we acquired sticks to help us balance, and
    then we came to grips with the terrain. We walked through forest for an hour
    or two trying to avoid icy lumps of snow falling down our necks, and then
    continued the climb above the tree line.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we came over the top of the pass, we were greeted by the amazing sight of
    Glacier Grey, and then followed a very steep, slippery, descent; of what
    seemed like hundreds of never-ending switchbacks of mud and ice. Numerous
    falls later, and covered in mud, we made it to the next camp at the edge of
    the glacier.
  </p>
  <h2>Day 7: Camp Paso to Paine Grande</h2>
  <p>
    Our last day of walking was expected to take about 8 hours, and we rose
    early to a beautiful sunny day. We made our way gradually downhill, back to
    the starting point of our hike, along the edge of the glacier, and then
    along the edge of Lago Grey, crossing many streams and two deep gorges on
    high suspension bridges. The trail was busy, as the walk up to see the
    glacier is a popular day walk from the hotel at Paine Grande, and we managed
    to finish just about all our food. We pitched camp in a large field next to
    the hotel, and spent the last night in our (finally dry) little tent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day was spent travelling back to Puerto Natales, first on the
    catamaran, and by bus, where hot (well, lukewarm) showers, pizza and beer,
    and soft beds awaited! We had the most fantastic experience, our spirits in
    no way dampened by the weather, which in hindsight made the trip.
