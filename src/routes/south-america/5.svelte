    After a 4 hour flight from Buenos Aires, we arrived at the tip of South
    America in Ushuaia, where we sat on the runway briefly, before connecting to
    El Calafate. It has been said that going to Patagonia is like sitting in
    your freezer and burning dollars to keep warm. We were prepared for the
    cold, not the cost! We checked into our hostel and set out in search of
    lunch, eager for a decent meal after basically not eating since the previous
    day. Virtually every restaurant advertised pizza, however it came as a shock
    to us that a simple margarita pizza cost the equivalent of about R220! The
    Argentinian peso is very close to the rand, and we found the cost of living
    in BA to be similar to South African prices – turns out the whole town of El
    Calafate is a tourist trap.

    The town itself is full of restaurants, curio shops and accommodation; there
    is not much to do except catch a bus to more exciting places. So we did…

  <p>
    Perito Moreno glacier lies 80km from the town in Los Glaciares National
    Park. It is classified as a stable glacier, neither growing nor retreating,
    and it is spectacular! It is 30km in length, and the leading edge extends
    into the lake as a huge wall of ice up to 70m high, where there is constant
    creaking and cracking as it shifts. Periodically, there is a thunderous roar
    as huge chunks of ice break off and crash into the water below, sending
    waves and icebergs into the lake.

    We were transfixed by this spectacle for close to 4 hours in spite of the
    cold, before the bus arrived to take us back to town.
