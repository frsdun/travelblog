    After El Chaltén, we had to catch a bus back to El Calafate, where we spent
    the night. The next day we caught another bus to Puerto Natales, Chile. The
    day was largely uneventful, with the bureaucracy of getting a bus full of 60
    people across the border posts the only real event. The temperature had
    plummeted, and it was freezing cold with a howling wind and scattered
    showers of rain by the time we reached our destination.
  </p>
  <p>
    Puerto Natales is a strange town stuck some 40-50 years in the past, despite
    the booming tourism the nearby national parks bring. The town is built on
    the side of an enormous lake, and comprises of mostly shabby wooden and
    corrugated iron buildings, with peeling paint, and held up against the
    elements by the neighbouring building and a couple of rusty nails.
  </p>
  <p>
    The town was to be our base from which we could visit Torres del Paine
    National Park, which has two famous overnight hiking trails: the “W” route
    (4-5 days) and the “O” route, which joins the two ends of the “W” and takes
    8-10 days. Earlier in our trip we had considered doing the “O” route, and
    then decided we didn’t quite have enough time, and we would settle for the
    more popular “W”.
  </p>
  <p>
    We arrived in town after 4pm, and wandered off for a talk on hiking in the
    park which had started more than an hour before. We caught the tail-end, and
    decided we should do the “O” trail anyway… Also, there was an outdoor film
    festival across town starting at 9pm, so our time was limited!
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next 3 hours, we drew money, hired camping equipment, made a mad dash
    through the supermarket for food, stopped at the dried fruit and nut seller
    and bought bus tickets to the park. We then walked to the other side of town
    where we watched the Banff Film Festival in an abandoned warehouse, and then
    back to the hostel after midnight to pack for the next 8 days!

  <h2>Day 1: Paine Grande to Camp Italiano</h2>
  <p>
    We caught the 7:30am bus in the nick of time, and settled into the 2 hour
    trip to the park. We had thought the early start meant we would be hiking by
    about 10am, and planned an ambitious first day of about 13km. However, on
    arrival in the park, there was some admin to be done and a video to be
    watched. We also learned that we had to book some of the campsites on route
    – the nights we needed were fully booked. Then another hour or so in the
    bus, then an hour or two of waiting around, and then a 30 minute catamaran
    ride to the start of our trail at Paine Grande.
  </p>
  <p>
    The park has two large hotels, a couple of free campsites (which need to be
    booked in advance – oops), and then a number of refugios – some basic
    accommodation, a small shop and paid campsites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The weather had improved from the previous day, and we set off at about 1pm
    with heavy packs in sunshine and a cool wind. We made our way along next to
    a beautiful lake, and dumped our packs at camp before climbing up a gorge
    along a river to a view point in the late afternoon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately the sun sets late, and we made it back to camp in daylight by
    8pm. By this time it was raining, and we convinced the park rangers to allow
    us to camp overnight without a reservation – the alternative being a further
    half hour walk to the next camp. We pitched our tent in the rain, had a
    quick supper and went to bed.
