    After a rest day with only a quick walk to a nearby waterfall, we spent our
    last day in El Chaltén doing a day walk to a 1490m peak, overlooking both
    Cerro Torre and Fitzroy. The weather was sunny, although still windy. The
    hike climbed gradually through a forest of strange trees (all half dead),
    before emerging above the treeline to a martian landscape of red and grey
    scree slopes.

    A steep zigzag path took us to the summit, where an icy wind was blowing –
    we took a few quick photos and then made our way back down to the shelter of
    the forest for lunch.
