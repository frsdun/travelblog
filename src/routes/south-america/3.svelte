    We spent the Saturday exploring the parks and gardens of Buenos Aires, which
    all seem to be clumped together in the wealthy northern suburbs of the city.
    Duncan was so excited to spot the spaceship Planetarium (pictured below),
    that we rushed inside and bought tickets for the next show, before coming to
    the realisation that the show would be exclusively in Spanish…

  <p>
    We persevered, and it turned out to be spectacular, we could at least
    identify a few of the constellations and somehow managed to get the general
    gist of the show.

    A pleasant afternoon walk ended at Puerto Madero (above), reclaimed land at
    the edge of the city, and an urban planning project to re-purpose the old
    port area. It comprises of new skyscrapers, an ecological reserve, 4
    “dikes”, and red brick warehouses which have been converted into restaurants
    and apartments. The water is like sludge, and the whole area lacks character
    compared with the vibrancy of the rest of the city. We did, however explore
    the decommissioned warship AMA Uruguay, and visited the art collection of
    the weathiest lady in Argentina. I was quietly mocking the childlike
    scribbles of one display, before realising that the drawings were by
    Salvador Dali (still not impressed)…

    Clockwise from top left: Rose garden in the park, statue in the park, “Pope
    Francis” waving to the masses in La Boca, San Telmo street market

    Sunday found us in the oldest barrio of the city, San Telmo, where there is
    a weekly street market full of leather goods, crafts and antiques. There are
    also street performers dancing tango, as well as the odd magician and
    puppeteer. We browsed the market early before leaving the crowds and heading
    south to La Boca. Generally a rundown, rather working-class suburb, a
    section of old corrugated iron houses have all been painted various colours,
    and these two streets host touristy restaurants and curio shops.

    Thank you to everyone who has sent us comments, we will try to post updates
