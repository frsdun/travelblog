    We had decided against hiking the Inca Trail on account of the cost and the
    fact that there are 500 people starting the walk every day. We opted instead
    to do the hike to Choquequirao – a 4 day trek to a set of Inca ruins similar
    to Machu Picchu, but with no access other than to hike.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our party consisted of 3 mules, two local guides / horsemen / chefs, and one
    other traveller, a Japanese-American girl. We started our hike where the
    road ended, high on the side of the Apurimac valley just outside the small
    town of Cachora. The first day consisted of a 1500m descent into the valley,
    along a gravel path through mostly dry scrub with numerous cacti along the
    path. We stopped at a small farm on the way for lunch, where our guides
    whipped up a two course cooked meal of freshly made soup, chicken and
    lemonade, before the final descent to our campsite next to the river at the
    bottom of the valley.

  <p>
    The next morning we started early, as we had a 1500m ascent up the other
    side of the valley to to the next campsite. We plodded slowly up numerous
    dusty switchbacks, the vegetation and temperature (and biting insects)
    slowly becoming more tropical, before arriving in a small village of
    Marampata, where we would camp, by about 10am. After a 2 hour rest and
    another cooked lunch, we had another 90 minute walk to the ruins of
    Choquequirao.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our guide claimed that there was a problem with his student documents, and
    he wasn’t allowed to join us to enter the ruins, so we st off on our own and
    enjoyed a glorious afternoon exploring the vast, steep site at our leisure.
    Unlike Machu Picchu, there are no roped-off walkways and no-one telling you
    what to do, and we virtually had the place to ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Choquequirao is thought to have been built as a checkpoint into other Inca
    regions, and may have served as a religious and administrative hub. Similar
    to Machu Picchu, it has numerous buildings and temples, multiple terraces
    for farming, and a series of aqueducts which feed into small baths around
    the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also an artificially levelled hill on one side of the saddle on
    which it is built – this is thought to have been an astrological site. The
    buildings have been relatively well restored, though by some estimates the
    site is only about 30-40% discovered, the rest being covered by the dense
    surrounding jungle.
  </p>
  <p>
    A steep walk down one slope reveals a set of about 80 terraces, decorated
    with llamas in the stone walls, and connected by a series of aqueducts to
    the ruins above.
  </p>
  <p>
    We walked back to our camp in the late afternoon, and arrived to another
    delicious meal cooked by our guides. The next day we retraced our steps back
    down, and then up the valley to our starting point, where we spent the
    night, before catching various public transport back to Cusco.
