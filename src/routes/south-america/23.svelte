    We left Uyuni and set off by bus with David and Alice to Potosí, one of the
    highest cities in the world at 4100m. We arrived in the evening to a city
    set on steep slopes, overlooked by Cerro Rico, a hill full of silver that
    led to the founding of the city in the 1500’s. The wealth from the silver
    mines made Potosí one of the largest and richest cities in America, at the
    expense of millions of African and indigenous slaves. Today the silver has
    long since dried up and the town has slipped into relative poverty, but
    about 20 000 miners still mine Cerro Rico for other minerals in appalling
    conditions. One of the main backpacker attractions is a tour of the mines,
    where tourists buy miners gifts of coco leaves, tobacco, alcohol and
    dynamite, and then venture underground to watch the miners at work in among
    dust and toxic fumes with little regard for safety. Dangerous and ethically
    dubious at best, we gave this a miss…

    The city is full of historical churches and buildings from its heyday under
    Spanish rule, as well as interesting local markets and public spaces, which
    we explored during our stay. We also tasted the best empanada’s yet: meat or
    vegetable fillings wrapped in pastry, similar to a cornish pasty are eaten
    all over South America, but these were by far the tastiest.

    The highlight of our time in Potosí was a visit to the old mint, which had
    been in operation manufacturing coins for the Spanish crown from the 1700’s,
    and functioned as a mint until the 1950’s. It houses the original machinery
    used in silver coin production, as well as a range of more modern machines.
    We had an entertaining guide who fancied himself as a bit of a magician, and
    said “thank you; thank you very much” like Elvis, in between explaining how
    Potosí is the greatest city in the world.
